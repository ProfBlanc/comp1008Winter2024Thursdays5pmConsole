Inheritance
    Create a class BASED on another class
        every class inherits Object class
            default constructor
            getClass(), equals(), toString(), hashCode()
    Why use inheritance
        use previously existing things
            mehthods
            instance variables
            constants (static final instance variable)
    What is inherited
        all non-private
            instance vars
            methods
            constants
            default constructor

    Please note
        Only default constructor inherited
        You cannot remove existence of anything

base class                                  derived class
parent class                                child class
super class                                 sub class

Keyword to create a class based on another class is extends


Java only supports single-class inheritance
    You can only inherit from one other class

General                 Specific

Overriding
    Create a brand new implementation of a method
        out with the old and in with the new



Polymorphism
    Poly
        many/multiple
    Morphism: body/form

Polymorphism: Something that has many versions/forms/instances/variations
    Overriding              replacing the body/behaviour: parent-child classes
    Overloading             varying:  within class


Abstract Class
Interface

    Both dedicated component classes
    Cannot be instantiated by itsself

What's the difference
Internal component              Abstract Class
External component              Interface


Abstract Class
    dedicated super class
    has the same features of a Concrete class (class that can be instantiated)
    may have an abstract method
        method with no method body. with no default implementation
    incomplete class

Interface
    more limited than Abstract class
        allowed to include abstract methods & constants
    a list/series of requirements
    only public accessibility level
    handle user-interaction


Game part 1:
Me: state an object
You: should be Abstract class, Concrete Class, Interface

Q1) Does object exist by itself?
        Yes: Concrete
        No: ask 2nd question

Q2) Is object an internal component or external component
    Internal: Abstract
    External: Interface

House                       C
Apartment Room (Apt 101)    A
Door                        I

Car                         C
List abstract components of Car
                Engine
                Suspension
List interface  components of Car
    Steering Wheel
    Door
    Tires

Game part 2:

Me: State a feature
You: if feature is possible in C        A       I


constructors        CA
constants           CIA
instance vars       CA
abstract method     AI
regular method      CA


A class can implement many interface
but only extend 1 other class


Human
Skeleton
Heart
Hair
Hand

Concrete	Abstract	Interface
Human		Heart		Hair
		Skeleton	Hand




Human=>	Skeleton=>Heart

class Human extends Skeleton

abstract class Skeleton extends Heart

abstract class Heart
