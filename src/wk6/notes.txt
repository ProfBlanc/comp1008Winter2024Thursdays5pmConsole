ArrayList
    dynamic collection of objects
        A series of shortcuts that point to real data
            real data = object created
    only accept reference data types
        int, double, short, byte, boolean, char
        Integer, Double, Short, Byte, Boolean, Character
    a capacity => think waterbottles
        dynamic. if surpass capacity => increases

Car class
    Color: only 3 colors
    number of doors: 2, 4, 5
    speed: 0-400
    transmission type: manual, auto, cvt

Unit Testing?
    Testing the output of a method
        process that is measurable
    of expected behaviour
    resulted behaviour


Create the following test cases
    using the default constructor
        Test
            speed = 0       assertEquals
            doors = 2       assertEquals
            Car object is not null  assertNotNull

Create a paramaterized test
    test the setSpeed method
        test 5 invalid values: < 0 || > 400
