Class
    a blueprint, template to follow
    outlines
        attributes aka characters aka instance variables
            variables declared in the class

        actions aka bahaviors aka methods/functions
            functions that evaluate one or many attributes


Goal of creating a class is
    (re)produce an object thats follows the guideline

encapsulation
    only gonna present/use/outline what we need to accomplish the task
    hiding data

creating object = instantiate

constructor = special method with no return data type. Called once, new Class()
              has same name of class

  enum: enumerable: create a drop-down list of options to limit which values
  a user can enter

  // two parts
  // creating the list of possibilities
  // create an instance variable that holds ONE of the values



  4 access levels
    public      anyone anywhere can access
    private     only accessible inside class
    protected   only accessible inside package
    default/package-private   ^


getter/setter
accessor/mutator
    provide access to an other inaccessible instance variable
